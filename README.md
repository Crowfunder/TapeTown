# Intro
The open task **TRAVEL** left us gazing back at the summer period. Our take on *calm, more informed, simply more enjoyable* travel is:
# TAPE TOWN

We reimagined traveling to cities by making a **mobile app** which is both *social by design and mindful of the way we sightsee*. The focus was on *real life experiences augmented by social context* focusing on experiencing the city without the digital distractions. Ok, but how does it work?
# UX
The user is confronted with audio recordings, named *Tapes*, that only appear in the vicinity of special places. 

> Human stories surrounding anything make it appealing, they show us the real value of it.

The same case stands when exploring urban areas. Everyone has a story to tell, and everyone can appreciate their travels more. Social media format is made for sharing stories. We provide context to places that otherwise would be incomplete to appreciate without a tour guide. 
# UI

The interface is intuitive and slightly skeuomorphic. It takes heavy inspiration from the *80s, the era of walkmans*, which is in the DNA of this project. 
# Used Technologies
This project was made possible by us, team aye! It includes Sebastian, team lead and his crew, Gabriela, Kiryl and Tymon. We created the app in python, javescript., flask, sqlit4e and figma.
